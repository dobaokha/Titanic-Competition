# Titanic Competition (In Progress)
•	Performed an end-to-end machine learning project to predict survival rate on the famous Kaggle’s Titanic Competition.
•	Performed the cleaning and EDA process using Python’s Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn to manipulate data and scikit-learn to build machine learning models.
•	Performed feature engineering using Custom Transformer and Transformation Pipeline to automate the process and facilitate the workflow.
•	Currently utilizing SGD Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to predict the survival rate with the initial ROC score of 84.39% and 84.35% score.
•	Working on Error Analysis and Tuning the models using GridSearchCV before making the submission
